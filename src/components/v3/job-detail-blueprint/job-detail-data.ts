// It held the demo job ("Roof tear-off & reroof — 4812 Maple Ave"), its crew,
// change orders, photos and expenses, and BOTH editions rendered it for every
// `[id]`. That is gone: the page reads the real Job row now (see
// ./job-detail-load.ts) and this module keeps only what a fixture never was —
// the type of a record, the status vocabulary, and the money formatter.
//
// Nothing here touches the database, so it is safe to import from a client
// component; the load module is the server half and imports these types back.
//
// DATES ARE STRINGS ON PURPOSE. Every field below that reads like a date is
// pre-formatted on the server (same rule as client-detail-data.ts): a `Date`
// formatted inside a client component is formatted twice, once per
// environment, and the first machine whose clock or locale disagreed would
// produce a hydration mismatch.

// client contact reduced to the name on the door and the address to drive to.
//
// The withholding is done in the LOADER — a worker's record carries empty
// arrays and nulls because those columns were never selected, not because the

// that would otherwise show an empty Change orders card, and to add the one
