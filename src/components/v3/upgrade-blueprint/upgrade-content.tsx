// PLANS & UPGRADE — the client half of /dashboard/upgrade. See the page for
// what this surface is; see upgrade.css for why the styling is a plain,
// self-scoped stylesheet.
//
// 2026-09-02 REWORK (owner's calls):
//   · A plan change is made IN PLACE on the existing Stripe subscription
//     (actions/billing.changePlan): up charges the prorated difference now,
//     down is free — checkout only when there is no subscription yet. The old
//     build opened a fresh Checkout for every click, which minted a SECOND
//     subscription beside the first.
//   · Cards are one row's height (a subgrid since 2026-10-12: prices and
//     first rows on one line); every benefit is listed, nothing scrolls or
//     folds inside a card, and the button sits at the foot of every card,
//     full width, blueprint blue.
//   · MONTHLY | ANNUAL (owner, 2026-10-12): one switch over the row
//     (components/billing/PlanTermSwitch). A plan with no yearly price is
//     shown and bought monthly whatever the switch says (lib/planDeal).
//   · Only the clicked button goes busy. `disabled={Boolean(busy)}` used to
//     dim all three the moment one was pressed.
//   · A downgrade asks first ("Are you sure…?").
//   · After a change the router is refreshed, so the sidebar's locks and
//     quota pills redraw without a manual reload — including on the return
//     leg from Stripe, where the page is reached with ?session_id.
//   · CUSTOM PLAN: an org already on it can ADD PAGES here. The page is
//     charged once now ($10 each), the subscription price steps up, and the
//     next cycle bills the new total — no second charge for the base.
