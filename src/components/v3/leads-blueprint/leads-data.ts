 * swept up every lead the contractor entered themselves — a CSV import, a
 * pasted email, a by-hand row all land as NEW (see importLeads) and so appeared
 * in a queue asking them to accept or decline their own typing. Source is what
 * separates the two: only leadOffers.ts (an accepted offer, CLAIMED) and
 * adminLeadCenter.ts (a manual admin assign, ROUTED) ever write LEAD_CENTER.
 *
 * Live LeadOffer rows are rendered alongside these and are platform-only by
 * construction, so they need no test of their own.
