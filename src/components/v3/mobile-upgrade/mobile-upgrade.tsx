// PLANS & UPGRADE · HANDHELD — the phone build of /dashboard/upgrade.
//
// Stands beside the desktop build (components/v3/upgrade-blueprint/*, which is
// untouched) and shares its whole data layer verbatim: the same catalog props
// the server page loads, the same `expandPlanFeatures` fold, the same
// /api/checkout/subscription POST and the same two server actions
// (billing.changePlan, billing.addCustomPages). Nothing here is a fixture and
// nothing here is a second endpoint — the props type is IMPORTED from the
// desktop module so the two surfaces cannot drift apart.
//
// WHAT CHANGES IS THE COMPOSITION, not the behaviour:
//   · The desktop's four side-by-side columns restack into one scrolling
//     column of full-width cards. A card is a decision, and on a phone a
//     decision gets the whole width.
//   · The feature list does not scroll inside a fixed-height card — it cannot,
//     at 390px — and since 2026-10-12 it does not fold either: every row is
//     listed, ticked or dashed in the catalog's order, as on the desk. The
//     cards are one swiped row (a subgrid: the prices and first rows stand on
//     one line, every card is the row's height).
//   · The confirmation and the page picker are BOTTOM SHEETS, hand-rolled and
//     portalled to <body>. Portalled because this page renders inside the desk
//     shell's content column on /dashboard/upgrade, which is a stacking
//     context under the shared handheld topbar — a fixed overlay declared in
//     here would slide under the bar it is supposed to cover.
//   · Every control clears the 44px touch floor and the primary action of each
//     card sits at its foot, where the thumb already is.
//
// Behaviour kept, one for one, from the desktop build: the Monthly | Annual
// switch over the cards (components/billing/PlanTermSwitch, "N months free",
// never a percentage — 2026-10-12); up = confirm then Stripe Checkout; down = confirm
// then the in-place `changePlan` (falling back to checkout when the org has no
// subscription yet); only the PRESSED button goes busy; the custom-plan picker,
// including the `?custom=1` deep link and the "add pages" variant for an org
// already on Custom; and the one-shot refresh on the ?session_id return leg so
// the sidebar's locks and quota pills redraw.
