/* Invisible. Two side effects of a landing view, both after paint:

   1. MEMORY. When the variant came from an explicit `?industry=` the page
      remembers it for 30 days in a first-party cookie, the same way the promo
      capture remembers `?promo=`. The cookie is for /auth/register ONLY — it
      pre-selects the trade when the visitor arrives there later with no
      parameter (and on the return from Google). The landing itself never
      reads it (owner, 2026-09-10): no parameter is always the default page.

   2. ANALYTICS. One `landing_view` per page load with the industry that was
      shown ("default" when none) and whatever utm_* the visit carried. Goes
      through trackTraffic, which queues until PostHog is initialised and
      never throws. When the headline was an ad's opening line (`?hook=`,
      2026-10-04) the event names it as `hook`, so one hook can be read
      against another; a view of the trade's own hero carries no `hook`. */
