/* LANDING-E — THE landing, mounted at `/` (owner, 2026-09-16). It began as
   the test copy of landing-d (2026-09-10) and won: honest trial copy, the
   three-field register, the first-estimate card, the welcome email, Google
   One Tap, the neutral ink palette and the phone pass. landing-d is gone;
   the trade data (landing-variants, landing-groups, smart-scenarios) lives
   here now. Its events still carry `variant: "e"` so the admin's d-vs-e
   history reads on. */
/* The landing itself, as one component; the CSS import lives here so any
   entry point pulls it in by rendering this.

   Section order is the argument the page makes: what it is (hero, intro), what
   it does (estimators, the wall of real work), then the four surfaces a shop
   lives in (proposals, portal, jobs, money), then proof and the close.

   TRADE VARIANTS (2026-09-06). An ad link carrying `?industry=fencing` swaps
   the hero and the showcase's opening slide; every register link on the page
   then carries the industry (and the visit's utm_*) into /auth/register. The
   variant is resolved by the entry point on the server and handed down as
   props — nothing in this tree reads the URL — so the first paint is already
   the right one. With no variant every prop below is its default and the
   page renders exactly as it did before.

   THE ORDER IS A LIST, AND A LANDING MAY HAVE ITS OWN (2026-10-04). The
   blocks below are keyed by section and laid out in landingSectionOrder()
   (lib/landing-sections) — the list the section tracker and the admin's
   analyst read too. Every landing but roofing, HVAC and fencing gets the
   order above, to the byte. Those three are where the trade ads land, and the
   analyst's reading of the ads was: the demo is the third screen, behind
   the comparison; the hero does not continue the ad's line; no price in the
   first screen. So there the estimators come directly under the hero and
   the comparison moves down beside the pricing; `?hook=` puts the ad's
   opening line in the headline; the hero carries the estimator's plan price
   (when the plan cards name it), plays its sequence on a phone and has a
   sign-up button under the shot (landing-variants.ts). */
