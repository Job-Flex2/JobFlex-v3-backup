/* TRADE-ADAPTIVE HERO — the one table behind `?industry=`.
   Copy pattern (owner, 2026-09-10): h1 "The full [result]. / From just
   [input]."; sub lists what is inside, and the time.
   ============================================================
   An ad lands on jobflex.app/?industry=<trade> and the landing swaps ONLY its
   first screen: the headline, the line under it, the primary button's words,
   the product shot, and which estimator the showcase opens on. Everything
   below the fold is shared. Without the parameter the page is byte-for-byte
   what it was — DEFAULT_LANDING is the hero's original copy moved here.

   The variant is resolved ON THE SERVER (src/app/page.tsx reads the query —
   only the query) so the first paint already carries the right hero; nothing
   here sniffs the client. This module is deliberately free of next/headers so both
   the server page and client components can import it.

   ONE KEY PER TRADE. The keys are the 20 real trades of TRADE_TYPES ("Other"
   is not a direction anyone advertises), as URL slugs. Every key already
   works end to end — the register links carry it, the register form
   pre-selects the trade, the cookie remembers it — and a key whose entry is
   still null simply shows the default hero. Filling a trade in is data:
   write its LandingVariant, and if it plays the Smart Proposal sequence, its
   scenario in smart-scenarios.ts. */
