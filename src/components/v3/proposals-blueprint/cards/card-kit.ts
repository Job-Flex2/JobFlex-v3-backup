// ALL-LIST CARD VARIANTS (2026-10-30, owner review): /dashboard/proposals?card=a|b|c draws the All tab's
// proposal cards through one of three candidate designs. Without the parameter the page is unchanged.
//
// A variant is a function that returns the HTML for ONE proposal, as `<tr>` rows (the list is a
// `<tbody id="propTableBody">`, so everything sits in `<tr><td colspan="6">…</td></tr>` or in real cells).
// The page's behavior finds a proposal by `[data-id]` and acts on `[data-act]` buttons, so every row a
// variant draws carries `data-id`, and the first one carries the class `prow` (the list counts, opens and
// staggers `.prow`). Chained proposals (same project) get `chain` — " prow--chain" / " prow--chain-end" —
// and `data-grp` on every row, exactly like the classic row.
//
// The kit hands over the page's own helpers (they close over its state), so a variant prints the same
// figures, links and buttons as the classic card and every button keeps working.
