// desktop blueprint shell above 768px, the handheld rebuild at or below it.
// The switch is a MEDIA QUERY, never the user agent — the mobile-first rule
// forbids UA detection, and a query is also the only thing that makes DevTools'
// device toolbar work: drag the viewport under 768px and the surface swaps
// live, no reload and no second URL to remember.
//
// Exactly one tree is mounted, never both. That matters more than it looks.
// The mobile shell is `position: fixed; inset: 0` and its mount effect sets
// `body { overflow: hidden }` — rendering it on top of a live desktop shell
// would strand the desktop page's scroll and leave twenty-odd sidebar links
// sitting in the tab order underneath an opaque overlay.
//
// Routes with no handheld build yet (/dashboard/leads, /jobs, /crm, /calendar,
// …) fall through to the desktop shell at every width, deliberately: a page
// you have to pan around beats a half-built mobile one.
