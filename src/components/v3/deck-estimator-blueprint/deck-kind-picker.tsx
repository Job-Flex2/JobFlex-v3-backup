// WHAT TO BUILD, SHOWN (2026-10-11, owner: "the selection of what to do is
// very cheap looking — make it interactive samples of what kind of a deck
// project you do"). The first step's four words are now four pictures the
// engine built (lib/deck/samples → lib/deck/iso): a deck with its rails and
// stairs, a covered deck under its gable, an octagon gazebo, a pergola on
// the house. Touching a card stands its picture up layer by layer — the
// footings, the posts, the frame, the boards, the rails, the roof — and
// choosing one is choosing the kind. Under the chosen kind sit samples to
// start from; one tap lays the sample over the contractor's own address,
// site, house and lumber, and the 3D on the right follows.
//
// Made real (2026-10-13, owner: "more realistic, detailed, modern, a little
// glassy — and interactive"): the pictures are lit and drawn in their
// materials (lib/deck/iso), and they turn — a mouse drags one round, a
// hovered card turns slowly on its own once it has stood up, the ↻ beside
// it turns it a third of the way for a thumb or a keyboard, and every
// picture eases back to its own angle when it is left. While a picture is
// moving it is drawn quicker (fewer parts, no grain) and settles into full
// detail when it stops.
//
// No WebGL here: each picture is a few thousand SVG faces, computed once
// per page for its resting angle and on the fly while it turns.
