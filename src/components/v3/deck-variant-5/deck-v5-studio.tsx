// DECK ESTIMATOR — VARIANT 5: "START FROM THE DECK PEOPLE ASK FOR" (2026-10-18).
//
// The bet: most jobs are one of a handful of decks. The page opens on a gallery of those decks as pictures, each with
// its usual size and what it comes to on this shop's rate book at this address (deck-v5-gallery.tsx). Picking one
// lands on a two-pane editor: the deck standing in 3D on the left; on the right only what usually changes — the size,
// the height, the boards, the rails, the stairs — as large controls under the live price, and every rarer choice
// (the kind, the shape and levels, the house wall plan, the site, the structure, the trim, the roof, the lights) in a
// named "More" that says what is set inside it while closed. The code checks are one status line that opens. The
// finish row stays in reach: Make proposal (the one blue button), Save draft, Send to client. Work opened again
// (`?draft=` / `?proposal=`) skips the gallery.
//
// Logic copied from deck-studio.tsx (the live studio, 2026-10-04 → 10-17): the settling, the patching, the house and
// deck agreeing, the 3D's build-up / x-ray / night / connections / picking / editing / placing, the drafts that save
// themselves, the client returns, the linked proposal and its update, the photo flow (dormant there and here,
// PHOTO_ENABLED), the custom products, the own items, the rate book. Its comments' intent is kept where it was copied.
