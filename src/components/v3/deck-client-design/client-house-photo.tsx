// THE CLIENT BUILDS THEIR HOUSE FROM A PHOTO (2026-10-23) — Stage 4 of "build the house from a photo of the back
// wall". Owner: "so the client will just give the back wall picture … and it just takes the shapes and move it into our
// 3D shaper". The studio's own card and review (deck-variant-1/deck-v1-house-photo), the same read and the same
// lining-up with the picture's edges, through the link's doors (actions/deckClientDesign: the token the key, each with
// its own brake): the picture kept in the shop's folder under this link's own, so it goes back with the design and the
// contractor opens it in the studio. Nothing about prices here.
