// SUPPORT WIDGET — the Help control every signed-in user gets, and the
// composer it opens.
//
// ONE LAUNCHER, DOCKED, AT EVERY WIDTH — and why the floating plate is gone.
//   A globally mounted button parked in the bottom-right corner cannot hold
//   that corner against the pages. On handheld it covered the Smart Proposal
//   wizard's only "Next" (.wfoot), the dashboard error toast's only dismiss
//   (.toastX, no timeout) and the manual builder's totals-bar chevron
//   (.barExpand); dropping the plate to z-index 2 stopped the click-stealing
//   and then buried the plate itself under FloatingCostsCard (z 40), which is
//   PERMANENT furniture on /dashboard/proposals/new and /[id] — so above
//   860px, where the docked button used to be hidden, Help was unreachable on
//   both live proposal-editor routes.
//   The top bar is the one corner of the screen no page claims, it is already
//   where the handheld launcher lived, and it makes the control identical on
//   every viewport. <SupportLauncher /> renders there at EVERY width now, and
//   it is the only launcher there is.
//
// THE TWO PIECES TALK BY EVENT, not by props. `SupportLauncher` dispatches
// `jf:support` on `document`; the widget listens. Same arrangement as the
// estimator picker and the command palette, and for the same reason: the
// button belongs in a top bar three components away from the dialog it opens.
//
// WHO MOUNTS WHAT
//   · BlueprintShell        <SupportWidget> outside `.layout` (a node inside
//                           takes a grid column) + <SupportLauncher> in the
//                           blueprint topbar.
//   · MobileNav             <SupportWidget> + <SupportLauncher> in the topbar,
//                           for the handheld fleet.
//   · ResponsiveShell       <SupportWidget> for /dashboard, the one mapped
//                           handheld surface that kept its own topbar; that
//                           topbar mounts its own <SupportLauncher>.
//   · (dashboard) layout    <SupportWidget> for the ~50 classic routes — every
//                           billing and settings surface, which is exactly
//                           where the Billing and Account categories point.
//                           Its launcher is in the classic topbar, which is
//                           `hidden md:flex`; below 768 that group draws NO top
//                           bar at all, so the tab bar's More drawer carries
//                           the same control as a row. Still exactly one.
// THE ANSWER, RIGHT HERE (owner, 2026-10-15): once a ticket is filed the
// window says "Looking into it…" and asks for the support AI's answer
// (actions/supportLive) every two seconds for up to 90; the answer the
// customer was also emailed lands in the window, with "That solved it"
// (resolves the ticket) and "I still need help" (back to Open, a note for the
// team, the support inbox told). A ticket the AI hands to a person says so; no
// AI answer coming (switched off, drafts only) shows the plain confirmation.
//
// NOT the admin console (the operator does not file tickets to himself) and
// not the public or auth routes, which render no shell.
//
// EVERY MOUNT PASSES `signedIn`. The standalone /mobile-*-v2 review URLs render
// the same page components outside the dashboard layout and outside the
// middleware's matcher, so they have no session and no NavRoleProvider. A
// launcher there would open a composer whose send could only ever fail.
//
// The dialog is hand-rolled, not `.mdl`: those enter/exit keyframes are
// published by dashboard-blueprint/blueprint-global.css, which only the desktop
// shell imports. Same reason the estimator picker rolls its own — a control
// mounted in four shells cannot depend on any one of their stylesheets.
