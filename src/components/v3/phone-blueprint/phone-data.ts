// Phone blueprint — the page's row SHAPE, plus the donor's demo fixture.
//
// The shape is no longer the donor's abbreviation of `AiPhoneCall`; it is now
// a real projection of that model, filled in src/app/dashboard/phone/page.tsx:
// `rec` carries the actual `recordingUrl` (the <audio> source, not a boolean
// "there is one"), `lead` carries the actual `Lead.id` (so "Open lead" is a
// real link), and `transcript` carries the raw text so a transcript that is
// NOT speaker-labelled can still be shown instead of being thrown away.
//
// CALLS_SEED survives only as the fallback for a mount that supplies no
// entries (there is no such route today — the dashboard page always queries).
// It is a fixture: it has no recordings, so its player never renders.
