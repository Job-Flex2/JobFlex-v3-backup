// HOMEOWNER LANDING — the intake wizard. Donor `mountWizard(root, uid)`.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE IS A REWRITE AND NOTHING ELSE IN THE PORT IS ──────────────
// The donor builds every pane by concatenating an HTML STRING and assigning it
// to `host.innerHTML`, with a hand-rolled `esc()` in front of every
// interpolation. That pipeline is not carried across: this page takes free-text
// and file names from the public, and an `innerHTML` sink fed by public input
// is an XSS surface the app has no reason to own. The panes are real JSX, React
// escapes for us, and `esc()` is gone — every one of its call sites is now an
// ordinary `{expression}` child or attribute, which React escapes identically.
//
// ── WHAT IS PRESERVED, EXACTLY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Same panes, same order, same triggers, same copy, same timings:
//   describe → (thinking 850ms) → clarify → (thinking 850ms) → scope →
//   contact → done, with `‹ Back` jumps to 0 / 1 / 2 and `restart` back to 0.
//   `canRefine()` is `desc.trim().length > 0` (was `> 12`); `detect()` walks KEYWORDS in
//   order and only fires past 8 characters; `go()` collapses its delay to 0
//   under reduced motion.
//
// ── THE ONE NON-OBVIOUS FIDELITY DEVICE: `paneKey` ─────────────────────────
// `.pane`, `.q`, `.sl`, `.up` and `.guess` all carry CSS entrance animations.
// In the donor they replay whenever `render()` runs, because `render()` throws
// the old DOM away. A React tree that merely updates in place would never
// replay them, and the page would feel materially different. So `paneKey`
// increments at EXACTLY the donor's `render()` call sites and keys the pane —
// remounting the subtree and replaying the animations on the same events, and
// only on those events. Consequently:
//   · typing in `.desc` does NOT rebuild the pane (the category guess/menu are
//     appears or disappears, which is the one case the donor rebuilds on, and
//     the one case it restores focus and caret afterwards. Both survive.
//   · typing in a `.q-in` does NOT rebuild the pane, so answers are kept twice:
//     `answers` (a ref) is the live store the donor calls `S.answers` and
//     mutates on every keystroke, and `shown` is the snapshot the JSX reads,
//     taken inside `bump()` — i.e. at exactly the moments the donor's `render()`
//     would have re-read `S.answers`. That is also why a `.chip` stays lit until
//     the next rebuild even after you type over it: donor behavior, preserved
//     rather than "fixed".
//     gone since 2026-09-04 — the AI detects the trade at submit; the donor only
//     toggles a class), so `.cats.open`'s slide-in plays and nothing else does.
//
// ── FILES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The donor's `addFiles` / `pump` only simulated an upload, so the picker was
// hidden. Since 2026-10-23 the files are listed while the homeowner writes and
// go into the request's job folder for real once it is sent
// (use-request-attachments → lib/home/uploadClient, through the door
// lib/home/freshRequest opens to the request just sent). The CONTACT step: it calls `submitHomeownerRequest`,
// which writes the request, starts the cascade and emails the homeowner. The
// donor read none of those fields and jumped straight to "on its way", so a
// project sent from this page reached nobody.
