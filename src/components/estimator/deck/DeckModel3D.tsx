// THE DECK STUDIO'S 3D (2026-10-04; roofs 2026-10-10; version 3 M3 2026-10-10).
// Vanilla Three.js, like FenceModel3D and RoofModel3D: the renderer, the sky,
// the lights and the ground are built ONCE; the structure itself is a group
// rebuilt whenever the scene's data changes, and the things that change many
// times a second — how much is standing, the x-ray, the night — only touch
// instance counts, material opacity and light intensity.
//
// Owner (M3): "show it as it is made in real — the cuts in degrees, the
// bolts, the hangers; zoom in on any part; the lights light up." So:
//   · every box is placed by its own matrix, and a sloped member (a rafter,
//     a hip, a rake board, a stringer) is SHEARED so its ends are plumb cuts,
//     the way a saw leaves them, instead of square to the slope;
//   · the hardware layer draws the lags, hangers, ties, bases, caps and
//     flashing where the engine put them, in galvanized grey;
//   · a touch on any part names it from the scene's legend (its stock, its
//     length, its cuts, its fasteners) and a click flies the camera to it;
//     the Connections toggle numbers the joints worth a look;
//   · the night view drops the sun, and the fixtures glow (a few of them
//     throw real light) — a fixture the client brings is drawn as a
//     see-through sample;
//   · when the studio is placing a fixture, a click reports the spot and
//     what it landed on, nothing more.
//
// The data is lib/deck/scene.ts's box list, in feet: x along the house, y
// out from it, z up. Here x stays X, z becomes Y (up) and y becomes Z, with
// the deck's middle at the origin, so the house is behind the deck and the
// camera stands in the yard.
