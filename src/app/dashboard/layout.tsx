// Blueprint layout — wraps the promoted blueprint pages (/dashboard and
// /dashboard/proposals) in the shared donor shell, so the sidebar and topbar
// mount once and persist across navigation between them.
//
// Scope: this layout only covers routes under src/app/dashboard/. The
// classic-shell children (/dashboard/proposals/new, /create, /[id], /ai,
// /templates and the rest) live under the (dashboard) route group, a separate
// branch of the tree, and keep their own layout untouched.
//
// The shell is wrapped in ResponsiveDashboardShell rather than mounted
// directly (owner's call, 2026-07-29): at ≤768px the two routes that have a
// handheld build serve it from this same URL, so the mobile design is reachable
// by resizing /dashboard into iPhone view instead of navigating to /mobile-v2.
// The switch lives at the LAYOUT, not in the pages, because the handheld build
// brings its own complete chrome — it replaces the shell, it does not render
// inside it.

// The sidebar's account block used to print the donor's demo identity — the
// literal strings "Ivan" / "Owner" — to every signed-in user. The real identity
// is read HERE, in the server layout, because the blueprint tree has no
// SessionProvider: `useSession()` inside the shell would return null. The read
// is deliberately non-fatal — an unauthenticated visitor is redirected by the
// PAGE, and a layout that threw would break that redirect before it ran.

// ROLE GATE (added 2026-08-17). This layout also carries the fail-CLOSED
// limited-role route gate that its sibling (dashboard)/layout.tsx has had since
// the RBAC rollout. The blueprint tree is a separate branch of app/, so it never
// inherited that layout — and the blueprint pages themselves only call
// requireOrg (authenticated + in an org), never a role guard. That left the
// middleware as the ONLY thing keeping an installer off /dashboard/financials,
// and the middleware is fail-OPEN by design: it decodes the JWT and, on any
// error, lets the request through. Same list, same helpers, same redirect as
// the classic tree — role from the DB, path from the middleware-set header.
