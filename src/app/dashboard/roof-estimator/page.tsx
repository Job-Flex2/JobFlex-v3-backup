// The sidebar and topbar come from the shared shell mounted in ../layout.tsx,
// so this page renders only the `.content` children.
//
// The two capability flags are read HERE because both helpers read process.env
// on the server. They gate the same things they gate on the classic route:
// without EagleView the form renders its "not configured" card instead of an
// intake, and without an OpenAI key the estimate generator returns a sample.
