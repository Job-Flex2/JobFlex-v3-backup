// Main dashboard — Blueprint edition. Pixel-identical port of the canonical
// donor (.claude/skills/jobflex-page-styler/assets/jobflex-dashboard-blueprint.html).
//
// The sidebar, topbar and sprite come from the shared shell mounted in
// ./layout.tsx, so this page renders only the donor's `.content` children —
// navigating between blueprint pages swaps the content and leaves the chrome
// standing.
//
// This page is NOT a fixture. Every region on the sheet — the KPI strip, the
// revenue chart's three ranges, Recent Activity, This Week, Upcoming Jobs and
// the Lead Flow board — is read from the database by `buildDashboardData` and
// handed to the behavior module, and the board's drag persists through
// `updateLeadStatus`. That read lives in ./dashboard-data.ts rather than here
// because the handheld edition needs the same rows and is mounted props-less
// by the responsive shell; see ./dashboard-actions.ts.
