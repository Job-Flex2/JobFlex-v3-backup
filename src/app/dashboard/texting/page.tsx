// Texting — its own page (2026-10-16). Until today it was the Texting pane of
// Settings; the owner moved it under AI desk in the sidebar's Automation
// section: who gets texted, from which number, saying what.
//
// The sidebar, topbar and sprite come from the shared shell mounted in
// ../layout.tsx, which also carries the limited-role gate: INSTALLER / SALES /
// ESTIMATOR could not open Settings and cannot open this page; every office
// role can, as it could open Settings → Texting. No custom-plan gate — Settings
// never had one, and texting is not a page the custom plan sells.
//
// THE READ is the same one Settings used (src/lib/settings/loadSettingsData.ts
// → loadTextingWorkspace): a plain module that takes the org context this page
// resolved, never a "use server" export keyed by an org id. Both editions — the
// desk page above 768px and the handheld build at or below — get this one
// object through ./texting-responsive. Writes are the existing actions
// (@/actions/sms, @/actions/textRules).
