// CHECKOUT FOR A SIGNUP THAT HAS NO ACCOUNT YET.

// prices for an organization that already exists. This one runs BEFORE the
// organization exists — the visitor is a pending intent parked by
// actions/signupCheckout.ts, identified by an unguessable token, and the
// account is created only when this session comes back complete.
//
// It is deliberately narrow:
//   · the token must resolve to a live pending intent (lib/signupCheckoutSession has the rules);
//   · the customer email is taken from the INTENT, never from the request body.
