// THE SIGN-UP'S HAND-OFF TO STRIPE, MADE BY THE SERVER (owner, 2026-10-19).
//
// Until now the browser handed itself to Stripe: the plan step asked /api/checkout/signup for a session and set
// window.location to it, and a back-out was told apart by a mark in sessionStorage. On a phone that hand-off could
// stall or be thrown away (Safari, Facebook's and Instagram's in-app browsers), and the page then drew Professional's
// own screen with "Add your card" — right after step 1, for the person who reported it. Here the answer to one request
// is a 303 to Stripe's card page, so the hand-off needs no script and nothing kept in the browser:
//
//   GET  ?signup=<token>&reason=step1|google|relogin            the plan the sign-up rule picks (lib/signupAutoPlan:
//                                                                Professional, monthly), with the 7-day trial
//   GET  ?signup=<token>&plan=<slug>&interval=MONTH|YEAR&reason=plan_pick   a plan card pressed (&deck=1: "Add Deck
//                                                                Studio" ticked — the add-on is a line of the order)
//   POST name, email (+ the landing's trade, tool, utm_*)        step 1 sent without JavaScript: the short sign-up
//                                                                (actions/signupOtp startQuickSignup), then as step1
//
// Stripe's back arrow (cancel_url) opens the plan cards (`?signup=<token>&checkout=cancelled`). When Stripe has not made
// the session within eight seconds, or refuses, the cards open with a line to try again (`checkout=failed`) — the one
// time the cards are drawn without being asked for. The switch off ("pick") or a trial without a card: the plan step
// as built (`checkout=pick`). Every answer is a 303 — never a page.
