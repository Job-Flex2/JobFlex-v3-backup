// SIGN IN — BLUEPRINT · the page.
// Route: /auth/login.
//
// A verbatim port of the approved mockup `jobflex-auth-login-blueprint.html`.
// Not a redesign: every string of copy, every class name and every CSS
// declaration is the source's (see ./login.module.css for the stylesheet and
// its drop/restore notes).
//
// ── REPLACEMENT, NOT A FORK ────────────────────────────────────────────
// This file REPLACES the previous /auth/login markup in place. It does not
// ship beside it as `/auth/login-blueprint`. That REVERSES the side-by-side
// convention once asserted in the header of
// src/app/dashboard/subscription-blueprint/page.tsx ("the standing repo
// convention a donor surface is never overwritten by its successor") — a file
// deleted 2026-08-12 when its port was itself promoted over the donor; for the
// auth family the instruction was replacement from the start.
//
// The old page's `md:hidden` MobileLogin half went with it: the source's own
// media queries (1000px / 560px / max-height 620px) are what makes this page
// responsive, so a second hand-built mobile tree would be a second design.
// ./mobile-login.tsx was deleted — it had exactly one importer, this file.
//
// ── STANDALONE CHROME ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Auth pages carry their own frame. Nothing here is mounted inside
// blueprint-shell and no shell file was touched. The wrapper <div> wears the
// literal global class `jf-auth-login`, which is the root every rule in
// login.module.css hangs off; everything else is a hashed local class reached
// through cx() by the source's literal names.
//
// ── AUTH BEHAVIOUR IS THE OLD PAGE'S, UNCHANGED ────────────────────────
// The mockup's <script> is a fake: it accepts the literal password
// "password123" and fakes a 900ms success. Only its UI behaviour is ported —
// the show/hide password toggle, the inline error slot, the "Signing in…" →
// check-mark "Signed in" button progression, and the Google button's busy
// label. The credentials themselves still go through NextAuth exactly as
// before: same signIn("credentials", { redirect: false }) call, same ?next=
// open-redirect guard, same three error branches, same toasts, same
// router.push + refresh, same dev-only prefill. No server action, no API
// route, no Prisma — the data layer was not touched.
//
// Two of the source's strings line up with the live handler by luck and are
// kept: its empty-field message ("Enter your email and password.") becomes the
// client-side guard, and its wrong-password message is byte-identical to the
// one the old page already showed for a CredentialsSignin result.

// gets a sibling file instead: its page is a server component, so the cycle
// cannot arise there.

// nothing linked to. That preview URL still works; this is what makes the real
