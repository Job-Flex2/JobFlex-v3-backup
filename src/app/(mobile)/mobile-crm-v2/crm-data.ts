// Mobile CRM (mobile-crm-v2) — shapes + pure presentation helpers.
//
// NOTHING here is data. The rows this page renders are read from the database
// in `crm-snapshot.ts` (`getCrmSnapshot()`), which runs the SAME org-scoped
// Prisma queries the desktop CRM sheet runs — see
// `src/app/dashboard/crm/page.tsx`. The former donor fixture (15 leads, 13
// customers, 4 rules, 8 follow-ups) has been deleted; this module now holds
// only types, enum option lists, class maps, page sizes and formatters.
//
// Mutations go through the existing server actions:
//   rules   src/actions/followUps.ts — upsert / setEnabled / delete
//   queue   src/actions/followUps.ts — runFollowUpNow / markFollowUpDone
//   leads   src/actions/leads.ts     — claimLead / deleteLead
