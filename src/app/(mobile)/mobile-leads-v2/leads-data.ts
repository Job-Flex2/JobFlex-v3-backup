// Mobile leads (mobile-leads-v2) — shape, vocabulary and pure helpers.
//
// This module holds NO records. The pipeline and the live Lead Center offers
// are read from the database in `leads-source.ts` (the desktop sheet's own
// query, org-scoped, sales-slice aware) and every write goes through the shared
// lead server actions. What stays here is the stuff that is not data: the row
// shape, the stage list, the status vocabulary, the source labels and the
// formatters the handheld cards use.
//
// (It previously carried the donor's 13-lead demo fixture, two demo offers and
// three demo CSV rows. Those were removed when the surface was wired to the
// data layer — a mock row on a page that also renders real ones is a lie.)

// The Incoming test is imported rather than restated: the two editions of this
// page must agree on what "incoming" means, and a duplicated predicate is how
// they stop agreeing.
