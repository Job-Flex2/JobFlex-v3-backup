// WRITTEN FROM THE CODE (2026-10-29). Every button, tab and field named in a step is the label the page renders,
// copied from its JSX or copy table; every `open` is a page in HELP_PAGES; every `show` is a `data-tour` on the real
// element (desk and handheld alike) or a sidebar row (`nav:<href>`). qa/tests/logic/smarthelp-guides.check.ts holds
// the pages and targets to that. A feature change that renames a label updates its guide in the same commit.

// Words: one action per step, what they will see next, no URLs or app paths. HVAC sizing is "Manual J-style".
