// THE DECK STUDIO ADD-ON (owner, 2026-10-19: "if existing users didn't purchase Deck Studio, they can't use it. Only
// preview it. And option to add it to the plan." — then: preview = design without saving, $49/month added to the
// plan, the whole studio during the free trial; owner-locked 2026-10-20 in CLAUDE.md: no plan carries it).
// Pure: the price, the Stripe line's kind, what a stored record says.
//
// $79 A MONTH SINCE 2026-10-26 (owner): $790 on a yearly plan. A shop that bought it at $49 keeps $49 — its line
// keeps the price it was bought at. Nothing that rebuilds a subscription's lines swaps an add-on line for the new
// price: the line is told by its price's `jfKind`, never by its amount, and is left as it is. What the shop pays is
// read off its own line (`DeckAddonRecord.cents`), never from DECK_ADDON_CENTS.
//
// The add-on is a SECOND LINE on the subscription the shop already has (lib/deckAddonBilling), never a plan of its
// own and never a second subscription: one bill, one card, one cancel. A yearly plan carries the yearly line — ten
// months' price for twelve, the custom plan's rule (lib/customPlan CUSTOM_YEAR_MULTIPLIER).
