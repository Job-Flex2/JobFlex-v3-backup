 * subscription id, so the upgrade either minted a fresh attribution with
 * qualifyingMonths = 0 (the window restarted — a "20% for 6 months" code paid
 * 6 + 6) or, once the code is no longer re-applied at checkout, found no
 * attribution at all (commission simply stopped at the upgrade).

 * cancelled ones included and newest first — so the OLD subscription is synced
 * after the new one. Moving the row to "whatever subscription was just synced"
 * would drag it back onto a dead subscription and stop the commission. So a row
 * moves onto a subscription only if that subscription is live AND was created
 * after the one the row is on now. The reference time is kept in SyncState
 * (attributionSubAt:<attributionId>); a row that predates this rule falls back
 * to its own createdAt, which is after its first subscription was created.

 * THE OWNER'S RULE (2026-09-22): a chargeback removes the commission exactly as
 * a full refund does. Until then only charge.refunded was handled, and a dispute
 * does not move charge.amount_refunded — so a lost chargeback left the accrual
 * standing, it cleared after the hold, and it was paid out.
 *
 *   charge.dispute.created  → the commission on that payment is HELD: out of
 *                             pending, the hold clock stopped, out of any payout.
 *   charge.dispute.closed   → lost: a REVERSED entry for the whole commission on
 *                             that payment (less anything a refund already took),
 *                             keyed by the dispute id.
 *                             won (or an inquiry closed with no chargeback):
 *                             nothing is reversed, the HELD rows go back to
 *                             PENDING and the hold starts again from the day the
 *                             dispute closed.
 *
 * AFTER A PAYOUT the commission is no longer ours to freeze, so nothing is held;
 * if the dispute is lost the reversal lands CLEARED — the partner's balance goes
 * negative and the next commissions pay it back before anything is transferred
 * (runApprovedPayouts always nets negative rows into a payout).
 *
 * The dispute's own state is kept in SyncState, one record per dispute under
 * dispute:<chargeId>:<disputeId> — a payment can be disputed again after an
 * inquiry closes, and each dispute runs its own open → won/lost course. The
 * record is what makes this idempotent by dispute id and safe against the two
 * events arriving in the wrong order: a created that lands after its closed is
 * ignored rather than freezing the money again forever.
 *
 * A DISPUTE CAN OUTRUN ITS INVOICE, like a refund can: accrueForInvoice reads
 * these records and holds, or charges back, a commission that arrives late.

/*
 * A REVERSED TRANSFER — NOT PAID TWICE, AND NOT LOST (owner, 2026-09-22).
 *
 * Before this, transfer.reversed set the transfer row to REVERSED and stopped:
 * the ledger still said PAID, "Paid out" still counted it, and the partner's
 * money was simply gone. Crediting it straight back to CLEARED is the opposite
 * mistake — a platform-initiated reversal (wrong payee, fraud, a recovered
 * dispute) would then be paid out again on the next run.
 *
 * So the rows this transfer paid move to REVERSED_TRANSFER: owed, visible, and
 * payable only after an admin chooses Retry payout (lib/payouts,
 * releaseReversedPayout) or Write off (writeOffReversedPayout). The request is
 * marked REVERSED for that decision.
 *
 * The books stay honest by appending, never editing: the transfer's PAID entry
 * (−X) stays as history and an ADJUSTMENT of +X in state PAID offsets it, so the
 * balance is again X owed, "paid out" drops by X, and the PAID bucket nets to
 * zero. Idempotent by transfer id: a transfer already REVERSED is left alone,
 * and the offset is keyed transfer-reversed:<tr_id>.
 *
 * A PARTIAL reversal is not guessed at: the rows cannot be split, so the
 * transfer is annotated and the Health row asks a person to settle it.
