// MORE TRIAL DAYS (owner, 2026-10-20; lib/trialExtension). Three emails, pure, no I/O:
//   · to the platform admins when an owner asks from "Before you go" — a work item, no greeting
//     (operator altitude, like build/operator.ts), with the one button to the request;
//   · to the owner when an admin approves — the new trial end, the button to the app;
//   · to the owner when an admin denies — the reason when there is one, the button to the plans.
