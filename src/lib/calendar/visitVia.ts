// CALENDAR · HOW A VISIT WAS BOOKED (owner, 2026-10-16: "check that the AI desk
// can make an appointment, that it lands on the calendar, and that its card
// looks different from a job card — make it smart").
//
// An Appointment is written by three paths, and the calendar used to show all
// of them as one sky-edged card with no word on where it came from:
//
//   ai-desk — the AI desk booked it on a phone call (lib/aiDesk/liveCall →
//             createBooking with channel "ai-desk")
//   online  — the customer booked it on the booking page (/book/<slug>)
//   plan    — a service plan's visit put it on the calendar (servicePlanBook)
//   team    — someone in the office added it on the calendar
//
// The channel is kept beside the appointment in SyncState `aptSource:<id>`
// (no schema change). Desk bookings made before that row existed are still
// recognised by the line the desk always wrote into the booking's notes.
//
// Pure, no imports: the calendar query, both calendar editions and the QA read it.
