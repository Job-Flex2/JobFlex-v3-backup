// EDITIONS — the vertical doors of one platform (owner, 2026-10-11: "let's do
// vertical"). A deck builder signs up at the deck door and works in the Deck
// Studio workspace: the deck studio and the office around it — proposals,
// clients, calendar, jobs, crew, money — and nothing of the other trades. It
// is the same account, the same data and the same sign-in as the whole
// platform; the edition is a view, never a second app, never a plan of its
// own and never a sign-in of its own (one door — the switches are gone).
// Whether the account holds the studio is read off its subscription (the
// trial, the add-on, a grant) and the asking user. Pure — the server reads the
// facts, this decides.
