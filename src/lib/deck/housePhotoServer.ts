// THE HOUSE PHOTO, SERVER SIDE (2026-10-23) — server only, shared by the studio's door (actions/deckEstimator, behind
// the studio's gate) and the client's (actions/deckClientDesign, the link's token the key): the picture checked, kept in
// the private store under a folder the caller names, and read by the vision model.
//
// THE READ MOVED TO GPT-6 (2026-10-26). It ran on gpt-5 (deprecated by OpenAI since) and fell back to gpt-4o, asked for
// "a JSON object" of fractions read off a grid drawn over the picture — and the owner's photos came back with windows
// the size of garage doors and a corner the wrong way round, run after run. Now: the Responses API, the answer held to a
// schema (lib/deck/houseRead houseReadSchema), positions in the picture's own pixels, a GPT-6 model — gpt-6-luna by
// default (OPENAI_HOUSE_MODEL; the close look OPENAI_HOUSE_CLOSE_MODEL), its thinking OPENAI_HOUSE_EFFORT. A model the
// key's project lacks falls back to the estimators' vision model, said once in the log. Two things new in the answer:
// what the picture IS — a room, a car, a plan drawing is refused with a word to the user and nothing is built (owner:
// "first we gotta make sure it's the house") — and the house's own silhouette, so the passes after it read only the
// house ("and we can copy only the house").
