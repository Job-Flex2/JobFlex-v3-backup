// move the walls left and right; start from the shape of the back wall where
// the deck will be attached, then set the deck in; make it smart"). Pure.
//
// The house is the deck's: its back wall runs along the house line, past the
// deck's two ends by `leftFt` and `rightFt`; it steps where the contractor
// says (a jog: to the RIGHT of `atFt` the wall comes `depthFt` toward the
// yard, or steps back), measured in the deck's feet from its left end, so
// the deck's own knobs never move them. The part of the wall under the deck's
// main back edge is the house line; a bump-out at the deck's end notches the
// deck around it on its own, and (2026-10-19) any other step under the deck —
// the wall set back, a bump-out in the middle, several — makes the deck follow
// the wall (shape kind "wall"); only a step the deck cannot follow is said in
// a note instead of being drawn wrong.
//

// already, and even windows and where the doors is … the color of the house … a window's height, two-story,
// one-story, the roof shape … it's not supposed to be very accurate, but if you can make it accurate would be nice"):
// a house may carry its real windows and doors (`openings`, in the deck's feet like the steps), its own colours as
// #rrggbb beside the presets, what the wall is clad in, bump-outs as tall as the house, and the photo it was built
// from (lib/deck/houseFromPhoto) — kept to look back at, never pasted on the wall. Only the house itself: what stands
// in front of it (a porch roof, an old deck, a patio) is not taken off the photo (owner, 2026-10-23: "read just a shape
// of that back wall and don't show existing deck or porch roofs, just shape and windows"). Without them the house is
// drawn by rule, as before.
