// THE CLIENT DESIGNS THE DECK (2026-10-11). Owner: "send the client a link
// where the client can design and send it back … the client doesn't see a
// price; the client can start from blank or from the contractor's design to
// correct and finalize; make it smart and easy for the client." — pure.
//
// A link is one SyncState row `deckclient:<token>` (no table of its own, like
// the studio's drafts): the contractor's design when the link was made
// (`base`), what the client has done so far (`work`, saved as they go), their
// note, and where it came back to. The shop's list of its links is one more
// row, `deckclients:<orgId>`, newest first.
//
// What the client may change is a short list: the kind, the shape and size,
// the height, the stairs, the railing's style, the boards, a lower level, the
// roof's look — and their own house (2026-10-12: they measure its back wall
// outside, its steps and corners, its storeys and colours; lib/deck/
// wallMeasure). The engineering stays the contractor's — the lumber and
// member sizes, the footings, the ledger, the site, the wiring, the rail's
// height — and is put back from `base` whatever the browser sends
// (mergeClientDesign). The frame is then settled to the tables, so what lands
// in the studio is a deck the tables carry. The client's page never prices.
