// THE DECK AGAINST THE HOUSE'S DOORS AND WINDOWS (2026-10-23, Stage 3 of "build the house from a photo of the back
// wall") — pure. Owner: "if there is a windows on the way, then … make it smart". Once the house carries its real doors
// and windows (read off a photo, lib/deck/houseFromPhoto), the deck is checked against each one it stands in front of:
//   · the door it serves — its threshold against the deck's surface (water, and the step the code allows);
//   · a window the ledger or the boards would run across, and a window under the deck (a way out of a bedroom);
//   · glass that becomes low glass beside the new walking surface (safety glazing);
//   · a covered deck's roof running into a window or a door where it meets the house;
//   · glass by the hot tub.
// Houses drawn by rule (no openings) are not checked: their doors and windows are a picture, not a measurement.
// Estimating grade — the building department decides.
