// WHAT KIND OF A DECK PROJECT (2026-10-11, owner: "make it interactive samples
// of what kind of a deck project you do") — pure.
//
// The studio's first step used to offer four words. Now each kind — a deck,
// a covered deck, a gazebo, a pergola — is shown as a real design the engine
// builds (lib/deck/iso draws it), and under the chosen kind sit samples a
// contractor can start from: a ground-level platform, a classic deck with
// stairs, two levels, a wrap-around; a shed roof off the wall, a gable, a
// hip with a ceiling; an octagon on the lawn, a square gazebo on its deck, a
// screened two-tier one; a pergola on the house, louvers over a patio,
// arched rafters on their own.
//
// A sample is a PATCH over the contractor's design: the address, the state,
// the site's snow and frost, the house's wall and the shop's own lumber and
// decking stay as they were set; the sample brings the shape, the height,
// the rails, the stairs, the levels and the roof. The same patch over the
// stock design gives the picture on the card, so what is shown is what is
// applied.
