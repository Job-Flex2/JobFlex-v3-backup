// THE ROOF OVER THE DECK, WORKED OUT (Deck Studio M2, 2026-10-10) — pure.
//
// Owner: "covered deck, attached or detached; a gazebo on the ground, a slab
// or a deck; posts, rafters, shingles or metal; beams around the posts and
// rafters on top; a beam on the ridge or rafters tied; all the materials
// recalculated when the size changes." One design (design.ts `roof`) goes
// in; out comes every member of the roof with its size, its length and where
// it sits in space — posts, headers, the ledger on the house, rafters, jacks,
// hips, ridge, king posts, ties, slats, braces, fascia, gutters — plus the
// roof planes (sheathing, roofing, ceiling, soffit) as polygons. The 3D
// draws these, the material list counts them, the checks read their spans.
//
// HOW IT IS FRAMED:
//   · Posts stand at the corners of the roof's outline (the "ring"), more
//     along a side when its header cannot span it. On a deck the posts run
//     from their own footings up through the deck (frame.ts takes them as
//     extra posts); on a slab they sit on anchored bases; on the ground on
//     footings.
//   · Headers (beams) run post to post around the ring; the rafters bear on
//     top of them. A header is sized from the code's DECK beam tables at the
//     load a roof puts on it: the strip of roof it carries, at the roof's
//     live-or-snow plus dead load, turned into the deck table's "joist span"
//     (two feet of 50 psf deck for each foot of roof strip at that psf). A
//     gable-end header also carries the ridge beam's king post, read as the
//     uniform load with the same bending moment (2P/L).
//   · Rafters are read on the IRC rafter tables (roofTables.ts) by their
//     horizontal span, header to ridge or header to ledger.
//   · The ridge: a BEAM the rafters bear on (open ceiling; the beam spans
//     king posts over the gable-end headers, or the wall and one king post),
//     a BOARD with rafter ties every 4 ft, or NONE — a hip or a pyramid
//     carries itself to the corners along its hips, which are one size
//     deeper than the commons (R802.3); a polygon's hips meet at a steel
//     ring.
//   · A shed or a hip on the house wall hangs its upper edge on a ledger of
//     2x stock one size deeper than the rafters, two structural screws
//     every 16 in.
//
// Every face of the roof is one shape in plan: an eave line, a run inward to
// its top (ridge, apex, wall or the cap of a lower tier), and a side at each
// end that is a hip (at the corner's half-angle), a rake (square to the
// eave) or the house wall. One routine lays the rafters on a face; the
// kinds of roof differ only in which faces they are made of.
//
// Coordinates follow frame.ts: inches, x along the house, y out from it, z
// up from the ground. A member has an axis in plan (`yaw`) and a rise along
// it (`tilt`); its box is `sx` long along that axis, `sy` wide, `sz` deep.
