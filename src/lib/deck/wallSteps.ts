// THE WALL'S STEPS FROM THE PHOTO'S OWN PIXELS (2026-10-23 night; the eave found on its own 2026-10-24). Pure. Owner,
// with the live read beside the house he expects: "still wrong — should be like on the second pic". The vision
// model, asked where the wall steps, found one corner of the bump-out and read it the wrong way round (the porch
// roof's side as the part standing out). The picture itself says both things plainly:
//   · WHERE the wall steps — a corner board runs the whole height of the wall, up BOTH storeys without a break; a
//     window's frame stands up only within its own storey, a porch post only below the porch roof;
//   · WHICH WAY — a part of the wall nearer the camera shows its eave higher in the picture (it is closer; the same
//     height looks taller) — a few per cent of the wall's height for a 2-ft bump-out seen across a yard. A porch roof
//     in front of a part does not move that part's eave.
// So: the corners where an edge runs up both storeys, then each part's eave — the shadow of soffit, fascia and gutter
// over the wall above it — compared across each corner. The eave is found by the picture, not by the model's line:
// the model draws its eave line a few per cent off (on the gutter, under the soffit), so the plainest shadow band with
// wall standing brighter under it, in a wide window around that line, is the eave; the other parts' eaves are looked
// for near it, and the darkest row of each (where the soffit meets the wall) is the row compared. The rows are read
// along the model's eave line, so the slope of a shot taken from one side is mostly taken out (an angled shot is
// straightened before this). Nothing is said where the photo doesn't show it plainly (no corner, no eave to match):
// the model's read stands.
//
// THE WALL'S WAY ACROSS THE PICTURE IS THE PHOTO'S TOO (2026-10-24 — owner, the same photo: "still wrong"). The model's
// eave and base lines lean a few per cent off the wall's real ones. Leaning 1½ % of the picture, the rows read along
// the model's line moved each part's band by more than a bump-out's step and the middle read level; leaning 3 %, the
// two lines looked like an angled shot, the square-on photo was "straightened", its corner boards leaned, no corner was
// found and the model's own steps stood. So the rows are read along the windows' heads — windows in one row on one
// part of the wall stand at one height on one plane (wallSlope) — and an angled shot is told by the upper row's heads
// against the lower row's (photoObliqueness): parallel on a wall shot square-on, closing toward the far end on an
// angled one. (The soffit's sharpest edge was tried for the slope and dropped: a porch roof's lower edge is sharper.)
//
// On the grey picture the browser makes of the photo (lib/deck/photoSnap's Gray), in the read's own fractions.
