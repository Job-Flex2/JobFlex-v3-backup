// THE HOUSE READ OFF A PHOTO (2026-10-23). Pure. Owner: "when I upload the picture of the back wall … get from that
// picture the approximate shape already, and even windows and where the doors is, and if there is any jogs, and apply
// it to the 3D shaper … if it's a two-story, one-story, if it's a roof shape … even the color of the house … the client
// will just give the back wall picture where the deck will be, and we just upload it". The contractor can upload it too.
//
// The vision model reads the picture (actions/deckEstimator readHousePhoto) and answers with the wall read the smart fit
// already knows (lib/deck/photoFit WallRead — the base, the eave, the storeys, the steps, the back door, the windows)
// and what a HOUSE needs besides: every door in the wall and its kind, the roof's shape, what the wall is clad in, a
// guess at the colours. Only the house's own wall (owner, the same day: "read just a shape of that back wall and don't
// show existing deck or porch roofs, just shape and windows") — a porch roof, its posts, an old deck, a slab are told
// to the model as things to look past, never a step or an edge of the wall. Two looks (HOUSE_ZOOM_NOTE): the whole
// picture to find the wall, then the wall cut out and enlarged so every window reads at its size; both on a faint
// grid of tenths the studio draws, so the fractions are read off it rather than guessed. The arithmetic that turns it
// into the 3D house is lib/deck/houseFromPhoto; the colours are measured off the picture's own pixels in the browser,
// the model's guess only standing in when that fails.

export const HOUSE_READ_PROMPT_PX = `You read one photo for a deck builder who will rebuild the house's wall as a simple 3D model. FIRST say what the photo shows (subject). THEN, if it is the outside of a house, read ONLY the house itself — its wall, its windows, its doors, its roof — and answer in the schema. If it is not, fill the rest with nulls and empty lists.
COORDINATES: every coordinate is in PIXELS of the picture exactly as you were given it — x from 0 at the left edge to the picture's width at the right, y from 0 at the top edge to its height at the bottom; the size is stated in the message, repeat it in "image". Measure each position on the picture; do not guess from proportions. In a box x0 is the left edge and x1 the right (x0 < x1); a window's head is its top and its sill its bottom; a door's top and its bottom (threshold) likewise.
SUBJECT: "house-exterior" when the picture shows the outside wall(s) of a house (a townhouse, a duplex, a garage attached to a house count) seen from the yard, the side or the street — a wall a deck could meet. "house-interior" for a room. "other-building" for a shop, a barn, a shed, a block of flats seen from afar. "not-a-building" for anything else — a person, a car, a plan drawing, a screenshot, a yard with no wall in it. "unclear" when you cannot tell. Confidence 0–1 and one short reason.
OUTLINE: the house's own silhouette, a polygon of 6 to 20 points going round clockwise — along the roof's ridge and its edges, down the walls' corners to the ground and back: the HOUSE, not the trees in front of it, not a fence, not a neighbour's house, not an old deck, a porch roof or a car standing in front of the wall (the outline runs behind them, along the house). Where the house runs off the picture's edge, follow the edge. Null when there is no house.
THE WALL: "base" is the house wall's bottom edge where the WALL meets the ground (or would meet it behind a patio, steps or a deck), at the house's left corner and at its right corner — the whole face of the house across every step in it. "eave" is the top of that wall above each corner: the underside of the MAIN roof's eave (on a two-storey house, the eave over the upper floor); null when hidden. "storeys": 1 or 2 storeys of wall between the base and that eave (count the rows of windows), null when unsure.
SECTIONS: FIRST work out the wall's sections, left to right from its left corner to its right corner: a section is a stretch of the house's wall whose face is one flat plane. "outFt" is how far that section's face stands IN FRONT of the main wall (the main wall — the widest stretch — is 0; a bump-out or a bay is +2 to +4; a part set back is negative). "why" is the evidence you see for that section's plane: its own corner boards at both its ends, its own eave or roof edge in front of the main eave, a shadow down the wall at its side, its siding meeting the next section at a corner. A porch roof, a patio roof or an awning in front of the wall does NOT make a section: the wall under it and behind it is the main wall unless its OWN face steps. A lower roof over only the GROUND storey of part of a two-storey wall, with that part's upper-storey windows above it, is a porch roof or a lean-to — that stretch is NOT a bump-out unless its upper storey stands forward too (its own corner boards up both storeys, its own hip or gable in the main roof). One section when the wall is one flat face.
DOORS: EVERY door in the wall, left to right, with its kind (slider, hinged, french); "ontoYard" true for the one door a deck would meet — the back door, the slider onto the yard — and false for every other (at most one true). A garage door is not a door here.
WINDOWS: EVERY window in the wall, both storeys: the outside edges of its frame left and right, its sill and its head. Windows side by side are one entry PER window — count them. Not the doors.
PATIO: a concrete patio or slab at the wall's base, its ends along the wall (only to know where a deck would go); null when none.
ROOF: the MAIN roof of the house — hip (slopes on every side), gable-side (the ridge runs along this wall, triangles at the sides), gable-end (a triangle of wall faces the camera), shed, flat; pitch in inches of rise per foot when you can judge it (a usual house is 4 to 8), else null.
MATERIAL: what most of the wall is clad in (lap = horizontal siding, vinyl or fiber cement). COLOURS: your best guess at the real colours as "#rrggbb" in plain daylight (not the sunset, not the shadow), null when you cannot say.
LOOK PAST, NEVER READ AS THE WALL: a porch roof or a covered patio's roof standing out in front of the wall, its posts and beams, an awning, a pergola, an old deck and its railing, stairs, a slab, a fence, a hedge, trees, a neighbour's house, a car. None of them is a step in the wall, an edge of the wall or its eave: a porch roof's low edge is not the eave; its post is not a corner. Read the house wall behind them — and list each such thing in "lookPast" with the box it covers, so the builder can keep it out of the picture.
BARS: black bands or a phone's status bar at the top and the bottom of the picture, in pixels of height; 0 when none. CONFIDENCE: how sure you are of the corners, the steps and the windows. NOTE: one short sentence a deck builder should know (a meter or a dryer vent on the wall, the ground sloping), else null.
Rules: a standard exterior door is about 80 inches tall and a usual window about 3 to 4 ft wide — use them to judge sizes; never invent a door, a window or a step you cannot see.`;
