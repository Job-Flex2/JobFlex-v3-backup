 * TWO BUGS THIS REPLACES, both found in the 2026-09-17 test run:
 *
 *  1. The number went to `sendSMS` exactly as the shop or the homeowner typed
 *     it. `sendSMS` accepts E.164 only and THROWS on anything else, so an
 *     ordinary "(206) 555-0143" — which is what every one of these fields
 *     actually holds — could never send. The project's own `toE164`
 *     (lib/phone) was already doing this job for invoices, payment reminders
 *     and change orders; the Lead Center path just never called it.
 *  2. Every call site ended in `.catch(() => null)`. So the throw above, a dead
 *     Twilio account, a suspended number — all of it landed in the same silence.
 *     With the provider switched on in production, nothing anywhere would have
 *     said that no lead SMS had ever been delivered.
 *
