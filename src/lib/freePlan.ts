// THE FREE PLAN (owner, 2026-10-13) — what a cancelled company is.
//
// Cancelling no longer leaves a company "cancelled": at the end of the cycle
// it has paid for, it moves to the Free plan. Nothing more is billed, nothing
// is refunded, and every proposal, job and client stays where it is.
//
// FREE OPENS NOTHING A CANCELLED COMPANY COULD NOT OPEN. Three mirror
// statuses are the Free plan, and lib/planStatus closes every door for each
// of them alike (the page gate, the feature tier, the limits engine at the
// "free" catalog row, the paid services, texting, the parcel tiles):
//   · CANCELED    — the subscription ended (the owner cancelled, support
//                   ended it, Stripe gave up on payment);
//   · FREE        — a complimentary plan ran out onto "free" (lib/planGrant).
// Free is how that state is NAMED — on the subscription page, the settings,
// the sidebar, the emails and the admin.
//
// The plan the company had stays on the row (Subscription.plan), the day it
// asked to leave on canceledAt and the day it moved to Free on
// currentPeriodEnd — the churn reports read them ("Free (was Professional)").
//
// Database-free and client-safe: the screens and the server share it.
