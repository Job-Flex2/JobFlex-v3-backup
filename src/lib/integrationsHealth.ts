// WHETHER THE OUTSIDE SERVICES ARE ANSWERING — one report, read from the
// admin overview, refreshed nightly and on demand.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. lib/sdk/integrations.ts answers one question honestly and
// only one: are the env keys present. That is not health. A ReportAll
// allowance can run dry, an EagleView pack can be denied, a Regrid token
// expires every thirty days and an OPENAI_MODEL can name a model the key's
// project may not call — and every one of those looks exactly like "enabled"
// until a contractor hits it mid-estimate. This module asks the cheapest
// question that distinguishes them, and writes the answer down.
//
// THE RULE EVERY CHECK OBEYS: no check may spend money. Two of them speak to a
// network at all, and both are free endpoints — OpenAI's models.retrieve
// (metadata, no tokens) and SerpAPI's /account (plan info, not a search).
// Everything else reads state this deployment already has: the quota header
// ReportAll answers with, the entitlement rows EagleView probes wrote, the
// last status Regrid returned, the last successful send of each transport.
//
// The report lives in SyncState under HEALTH_KEY, so the overview renders the
// last known answer instantly and nothing is checked on page load.
