// LIVE NOW (2026-09-28) — who is on the site this minute, where they came
// from, what they are looking at, and whether they signed up. Pure: the
// server hands in the last half hour of PostHog events (one row each) and
// the day's fresh organizations from the database; this turns them into one
// line per visitor, coloured by how far they got.
//
// Owner: "add to statistics at admin to look at live users when they are
// coming from advertisement and looking at the app; if they sign up make it
// a different colour — make it smart."
//
// What "smart" means here:
//   · A visitor is one PostHog person (anonymous id, merged on signup), not a
//     pageview — a reader flipping through five screens is one line.
//   · Where they came from is read off the FIRST event of their latest visit
//     (utm_*, then the referring domain): a tagged paid medium is an ad; a
//     Facebook / Instagram / TikTok referrer with no tag is "untagged — most
//     likely an ad" (the landing is not something people share for fun); a
//     search engine referrer is search; the rest referral or direct.
//   · How far they got is the furthest thing they did in the window:
//     browsing → on the sign-up form → at checkout → SIGNED UP; a person on
//     the app's own screens (/dashboard…) is a member, not a prospect.
//   · A signup is tied back to the organization the database just created
//     (the verified event and the row are minutes apart and carry the same
//     utm_*), so the line names the company and the owner.
//   · "On the site now" = an event in the last ACTIVE_MINUTES; up to
//     WINDOW_MINUTES they are "just left", shown dimmer, then gone.
