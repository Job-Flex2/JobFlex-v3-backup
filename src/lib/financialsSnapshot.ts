// THE FINANCIALS READ — one query set, two editions.
//
// These queries and the mapping into the page's row shapes used to live inline
// in src/app/dashboard/financials/page.tsx, which was fine while the desktop
// sheet was the only surface reading them. The handheld edition of the same
// route is mounted PROPS-LESS by the responsive shell
// (components/v3/responsive-shell/responsive-dashboard-shell.tsx), so it cannot
// be handed the page's data — it has to ask for it. Rather than let a second
// copy of these queries drift away from the first, both editions read this
// module: the desktop page calls it directly, the handheld one through the
// org-scoped `loadFinancials()` action (src/actions/financialsMobile.ts).
//
// SERVER ONLY — it touches Prisma. A client component wanting these shapes
// imports the TYPES from components/v3/financials-blueprint/financials-data
// (or the handheld copy in (mobile)/mobile-financials-v2/financials-data),
// never this file.
