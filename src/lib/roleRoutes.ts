// ── THE BLUEPRINT REDESIGN MOVED THREE SURFACES OUT FROM UNDER THIS LIST ────
// Reconnected 2026-08-18, owner-approved. This list is written in PATH
// prefixes, so a redesign that re-homes a page silently revokes it: the gate
// keeps allowing a URL nobody serves any more and the role loses the surface
// with no error anywhere. Three of those had accumulated:
//
//   · /dashboard/advanced-ai/roof  → /dashboard/roof-estimator
//     /dashboard/advanced-ai/fence → /dashboard/fence-estimator
//     Both sat under ESTIMATOR's "/dashboard/advanced-ai" prefix in the old
//     design. The blueprint ports gave them top-level routes, which the prefix
//     no longer covers, so the estimator role lost the two engines its job is
//     named after. nav-map.ts already listed them and had them dropped by this
//     gate — that TODO is what is being paid off here.
//   · /dashboard/clients/<id>      → /dashboard/client-detail?client=<id>
//     SALES is allowed "/dashboard/clients", and the client RECORD used to live
//     under it. The blueprint record is a separate top-level route, so a sales
//     rep could open the client LIST and not a single client on it.
//   · /dashboard/proposals/create  → /dashboard/manual-blueprint
//     The manual builder. It lived under "/dashboard/proposals", which SALES
//     and ESTIMATOR both hold, so both had it; the blueprint builder is
//     top-level and both lost it. SALES lost its create path entirely — every
//     engine in the picker was out of reach, so the topbar (which asks
//     ACTIVE_ENGINE_HREFS whether the role can reach ANY engine) stopped
//     drawing New Estimate at all.
//
// The additions are exactly those four prefixes and nothing else: no role gains
// a surface it did not hold in the old design, and each new entry replaces a
// path that role could already reach before the redesign moved it.
