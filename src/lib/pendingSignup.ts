// WHEN A PENDING SIGNUP IS STILL ALIVE — one rule (2026-10-14).
//
// A `signup:<token>` row (actions/signupCheckout) is an unpaid intent; it
// expires on read. The plan step's payment path (loadPending) and the
// passwordless sign-up's return (lib/signupOtp draftRestore) ask the same
// question here, so the register page never opens the plan step over an
// intent the payment would refuse ("That signup expired", owner's report:
// the draft lived a day, the intent two hours).
//
// A day, like the passwordless draft and its cookie: a code received and the
// plan picked in the evening still works. A card-less trial waiting on its
// emailed link counts the day from the latest link sent.
