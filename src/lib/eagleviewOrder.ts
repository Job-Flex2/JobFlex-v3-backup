// ORDERING AN ADDRESS PACK BY PACK — the planner behind measureRoofInstant.
//
// Until 2026-09-08 one request asked EagleView for all seven diagram packs;
// when the account lost its entitlement to any one of them the whole order
// was refused (403 / 10880) and the page got nothing, though pack 001 still
// orders. This module buys what can be bought:
//
//   1. [001] alone. It is the roof area, the one pack a measurement cannot do
//      without: a refusal here is the caller's error, as before.
//   2. ONE request for every other pack the account is known to be entitled
//      to (`live` in EagleViewEntitlement). Refused → the entitlement changed
//      since it was recorded, so fall through to 3 for those packs.
//   3. Pack by pack, in PROBE_ORDER, for everything unknown, stale-denied, or
//      knocked out of step 2. 202 → live; 403 → denied (a refusal is free);
//      anything else → failed, verdict unchanged.
//
// THE AREA IS THE MEASUREMENT; THE REST LANDS BEHIND IT (2026-09-18). Until
// 2026-09-17 every accepted order was polled to completion — up to 30 s each —
// before the next one was even placed, so a first click on a new address could
// wait 30 s × 7 and the function limit cut it off. The 2026-09-17 review then
// placed all seven up front and waited for all of them together, and the first
// live run showed the cost: the click waited the whole budget for the slowest
// pack, and with seven orders on the same address at once the area itself was
// still processing after it. Now the area order is placed ALONE and waited for
// ALONE (asked round after round, up to the budget); the moment it lands the
// other packs are placed and the click returns — those are reported as
// `pending`: placed, paid, and collected by the page without a new charge
// (collectPendingInstant), never as failed and never re-ordered. The page
// prices nothing until they are in.
//
// Whatever the billing model, only accepted packs are paid for: EagleView
// rejects a refused request whole. Every accepted request is written to the
// ledger BEFORE its first poll, exactly as the single order was (a lost
// requestId is a paid result nobody can fetch).
//
// Plain module, no "use server": the I/O comes in through `deps`, so the plan
// can be exercised against fakes without ordering anything.
