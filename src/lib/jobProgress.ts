// THE CREW ON SITE (2026-09-27) — server. One rule behind both doors.
//
// The worker portal's status route and the dashboard's setJobProgress used
// to each move the job and write their own trail row; neither told the
// office. Now both call `recordJobProgress`: it moves the status, writes the
// STARTED / COMPLETED row the bell and the job trail read (with the day
// number), promotes the proposal and sends the review request on
// completion, and — after the response — texts the owner and the manager.
//
// Stage A (2026-09-30): the days are WorkDay rows (lib/workDays), not the
// STARTED rows of the trail. A Start or a Back on site opens today's day,
// "closed" closes it (a note or a file of the day is required), Complete
// closes today's. The office moving the status goes through here too, with
// `silent` — the day counts, nobody is texted. The STARTED / COMPLETED rows
// and the texts are written exactly as before.
