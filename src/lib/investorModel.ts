// THE INVESTOR FIGURES (owner, 2026-10-06): "how much we spend on ads, how
// many users we get on free trial … and the main thing: how soon we cover the
// ad spend." Pure: dates and cents in, figures and a day-by-day curve out. The
// server gathers the rows (lib/investors); this decides what they mean, and
// the QA script pins every rule.
//
// MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED (owner, 2026-10-24: "we don't know how many users will
// pay after sign-up, only an assumption — remove the assumptions and use the
// current rate of how many companies stay after their trials"). The share of
// trials that pay is no longer the owner's 60%, nor "if every trial pays", nor
// the behaviour model's guess: it is the RATE MEASURED on the trials that have
// already ended — of those, the share paying today — with its 90% range for
// that many trials. The trials running now are expected to pay at that rate.
// No trial ended yet = no rate, and nothing is predicted from it.
//
// THE CURVE. Each day from the ad launch to the horizon has two running totals:
//   · ad spend — every dollar booked so far, then the last full week's pace;
//   · revenue — each paying account earns its monthly price a thirtieth a day
//     from the day it started paying; each running trial, at the measured
//     rate, from the day its trial ends; signups still to come arrive at the
//     last week's pace and pay, at the measured rate, after their trial.
// The break-even is the first day revenue stands at or above the spend.
// Revenue is at LIST price per month, not Stripe's collections (the page
// shows those beside it): discounts, taxes and churn are not modelled.

   A day goes apart WHOLE when free trials with no card were on offer at any time that day: the switch said so (a
   flip to "card" counts from the next day, so the flip day itself is apart — lib/investors builds the spans), or,
   before the switch was recorded, someone signed up with no card that day (a day with no signups follows the
   nearest earlier day that had some). Every signup of an apart day goes with it — a card given anyway too: it came
   in under the no-card offer — and so does a no-card trial that slipped in on a card day (as an account; its day's
   spend stays). What is left is the page: the card days' spend and the card days' signups that took a card. When
