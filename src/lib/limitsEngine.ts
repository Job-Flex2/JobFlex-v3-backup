// Limits Engine — per-plan NUMERIC quota enforcement.
//
// Distinct from src/lib/entitlements.ts, which handles boolean FEATURE gating
// (does this plan unlock AI proposals?). This engine answers "how many?" and is
// SERVER-ONLY (imports Prisma) — never import it from a client component. For
// shared key/scope definitions a client can read, import src/lib/planLimits.ts.
//
// Usage (wired into user-facing actions in a later step):
//   await enforcePlanLimit(organizationId, "proposalsCreated");
//   // …throws Error("Plan limit reached") when the org is at/over its cap.
//
// Resolution order for an org:
//   1. Load Subscription → `plan` + `status` + `currentPeriodEnd` + `trialEndsAt`.
//   2. Lapsed check: PAST_DUE/CANCELED/EXPIRED — or ACTIVE past periodEnd +
//      3-day grace, or TRIALING past trialEndsAt — resolves to the "free"
//      catalog plan (DEFAULT_FREE_LIMITS if no such row) instead of the paid one.
//   3. Load the matching PricingPlan and parse its limitsJson.
//   4. Unlimited (absent/null/-1) → allow immediately, no count query.
//   5. Otherwise count usage (windowed for "monthly", lifetime for "absolute")
//      and compare.
//
// Intentional ALLOW-BUT-COUNT paths (client/public-triggered creation is never
// blocked; the rows still count toward usage so the org hits its cap on its
// own actions). Keep this list current — it is the audit point:
//   - public quote accept → src/lib/jobFromProposal.ts (Job + JobEvent)
//   - public homeowner form → src/actions/homeowner.ts + api/homeowner-request (Lead)
//   - AI-call lead capture → createLeadFromCall (Lead)
//   - auto job-completion review ask → src/lib/reviewRequestInternal.ts
//   - auto job-crew thread → src/lib/jobConversation.ts (JOB kind, excluded
//     from the conversationsStarted counter entirely)
// Exception by product decision: over-limit inbound AI phone calls ARE blocked
// (polite unavailable TwiML in api/twilio/voice).
//
// THERE ARE NO COUNTERS. Usage is never stored: every check COUNTS the rows
// themselves (proposals, estimates, calls …) created since the start of the
// current cycle. A "reset" therefore cannot zero a number — it moves the
// point the count starts from. The admin's reset (lib/usageReset) writes a
// SyncState mark `usageResetAt:<orgId>:<key>` and the count for that key
// begins at the mark instead of at the cycle start. The mark holds only
// while it lies inside the current cycle (see usageResetInForce), so it
// burns by itself when the next cycle begins; nothing is deleted.
//
// PLATFORM ADMINS IN THEIR ORGANIZATION (owner, 2026-09-22; any seat since
// 2026-10-17). When the current user carries isPlatformAdmin and holds a seat
// in the organization being checked, the plan's caps do not apply: every key
// resolves unlimited, enforcePlanLimit passes, and the sidebar and the plans
// page say "Unlimited · platform admin" instead of counting. The rule is
// lib/fullAccess hasFullAccess — the one every access check asks — and the
// engine reads the session itself (no caller passes a user), so no action
// needs a check of its own. Where there is no session — a cron, an inbound
// phone call, a public form — there is no current user and the caps apply.
// Money is untouched: paid providers (EagleView, ReportAll …) keep their own
// budgets and ledgers; this is the plan's caps only.
