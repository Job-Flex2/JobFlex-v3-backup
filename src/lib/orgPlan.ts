/**
 * Resolve an org's effective feature tier.
 *
 * Two plan systems coexist: the built-in tier ladder (FREE/STARTER/PROFESSIONAL/
 * ENTERPRISE) that boolean feature-gating understands, and admin-defined
 * PricingPlans (arbitrary slugs) whose quotas are enforced by the numeric Limits
 * engine. When an org is assigned a custom PricingPlan, its slug won't match a
 * built-in tier — but it still means the org is on a real plan, so features are
 * unlocked here and the Limits engine (PricingPlan.limitsJson) does the metering.
 *
 * A LAPSED plan is FREE here whatever its name (owner, 2026-10-07): CANCELED,
 * UNPAID, EXPIRED, TRIAL_ENDED, or a period long over — lib/planStatus. A
 * failed renewal Stripe is still retrying (PAST_DUE) keeps its tier.
 *
 * A platform admin in the org (lib/fullAccess, the session's user) has the
 * top tier whatever the subscription says (owner, 2026-10-17).
