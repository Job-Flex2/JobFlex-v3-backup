// WISETACK FINANCING — every word a contractor or a client reads about it, in one place. Wisetack allows only its
// own financing language (marketing toolkit: "Don't use your own marketing language unless it's been explicitly
// approved by Wisetack"), and a rate, an APR or a monthly figure is a lending term only Wisetack states — none here.
// Wisetack's review of these words is part of going live (spec, Rollout 3).
//
// Pure: both portal trees, the editor, Settings and the checks import it.
