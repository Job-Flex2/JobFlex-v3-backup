// WHO CAME BACK (owner, 2026-10-28: "check if anybody started paying after the trial expired with no card, or
// cancelled during the trial and came back and decided to pay").
//
// Two records say so. A card-less trial that ended with no card (lib/trialState, SyncState cardlessTrial:<org>)
// gets `restartedAt` the day a card restarts the plan (lib/cardlessTrial, the trial-restart checkout) — that is
// "paid after the trial ran out", to the day. A cancellation booked from Settings → Billing is a CancellationFeedback
// row; when that company's subscription is active again, it came back — the day is not recorded (the subscription
// row is overwritten), so the next invoice date is shown instead. A cancel made outside the app (Stripe's own
// dashboard) leaves no row here; the win-back mails (lib/trialWinback) say whether the 10% offer went out before
// the restart. Pure: the read (lib/cameBackRead) fetches, this shapes; qa/tests/logic/came-back.check.ts proves it.
