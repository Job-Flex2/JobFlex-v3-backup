// A CALL TO A COMPANY'S NUMBER — server only (the Twilio webhooks are its callers).
//
// Which company: the number dialed (lib/aiDesk/numbers). What happens: the desk's mode
// and the plan — the phone assistant answers, or the company's own phone rings first and
// the assistant takes the call nobody picked up. A plan without the assistant (or one
// out of calls this month) still gets its calls: they ring the company phone. A company
// out of desk minutes (lib/aiDesk/minutes) keeps its calls too: the company phone, or a
// message — never the live desk, until a pack is added.
