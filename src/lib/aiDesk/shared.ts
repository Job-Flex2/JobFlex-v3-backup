// THE AI DESK — what a company's number does with a call. Pure, browser-safe.
//
// One number per company (lib/sms/registration buys it): it answers calls the day it is
// bought, and texts once the carriers approve it. This is the calls half. The settings
// live in SyncState `aidesk:<orgId>` as JSON — no schema change, like the registration.
//
//   ANSWER   JobFlex's phone assistant takes the call (today: it takes a message and
//            writes it up — the live desk comes with the voice server)
//   FORWARD  the call rings the company's own phone; a call nobody picks up goes to
//            the assistant's voicemail
