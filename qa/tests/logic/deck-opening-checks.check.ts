// The deck against the house's real doors and windows (2026-10-23, lib/deck/openingChecks — Stage 3 of "build the house
// from a photo"): the door's threshold against the deck's surface (above it, level with it, the steps the code allows,
// too far down) with the one-tap height that answers it; a window the ledger would run across, and a window under the
// deck; low glass beside the new walking surface; a covered deck's roof running into an upper window or over a tall door
// where it meets the house, with the pitch or the eave that clears it; glass by the hot tub. A house drawn by rule and a
// detached deck are not checked. Pure.
